== ProB

The ProB front-end for LTSmin uses ZMQ to communicate with ProB.
To use this front-end a ZMQ socket has to be opened first with ProB.
This can be done with the commandline
*LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib ./probcli /path/to/machine.[mch|eventb|b|...] -ltsmin2 /tmp/ltsmin.probz*.
The path to the socket is given with the option *-ltsmin2*. The file extension should be *.probz*.
